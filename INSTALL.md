# CANPi Maintenance Web Application
This functionality is distributed as a Debian package, as a compressed tarball,
and contained in an Apt Repository.

- The package and the tarball are available as part of a release on github
(`emthornber/canpi-web-app-ssr`)

- The Apt repository is available at [MERG-DEV Apt
Repository](repo.littlegarth.org.uk).  Visiting the site displays instructions
on how to setup the apt configuration to access the MERG-DEV repository along
with a downloadable script to carry out those instructions.
